# Movie Recommendation System

This project implements a movie recommendation system using collaborative filtering, focusing on both user-based and item-based models. The dataset consists of 5 distinct users who reviewed the same 5 movies on IMDB, which provides a unique dataset to explore recommendation techniques with a controlled user-item interaction set.

## Project Overview

### Objective
The goal of this recommendation system is to suggest movies to users based on the ratings and interactions of similar users and similar items. By employing user-based and item-based collaborative filtering, we aim to deliver personalized recommendations that leverage historical user behavior.

### Features
- **User-Based Collaborative Filtering**: Recommends movies based on the preferences of similar users.
- **Item-Based Collaborative Filtering**: Suggests movies by analyzing movies with similar rating patterns.
- **Scalable Framework**: Although this project is based on a small dataset (5 users and 5 movies), the code is designed to scale with larger datasets for future improvements or deployments.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project includes:
- **Users**: 5 unique users who have reviewed the same 5 movies.
- **Movies**: 5 movies from IMDB with reviews from each user.
- **Ratings**: Ratings given by users on a scale from 0 to 5.

This dataset structure provides a balanced foundation for building and testing recommendation algorithms in a controlled environment.

## Methodology

### Data Preprocessing
- **Data Cleaning**: Handled missing values and standardized rating scales.
- **Normalization**: Normalized ratings to ensure comparability across users and items.
- **User-Item Matrix**: Constructed a matrix where rows represent users, and columns represent movies, with cells containing the respective ratings.

### Collaborative Filtering Models
1. **User-Based Collaborative Filtering**:
   - Computes similarity between users based on their rating patterns using similarity metrics like cosine similarity or Pearson correlation.
   - Recommends movies that were positively rated by similar users.

2. **Item-Based Collaborative Filtering**:
   - Analyzes similarity between movies based on user rating patterns.
   - Recommends movies similar to those a user has rated highly.

### Evaluation Metrics
Due to the dataset's limited size, traditional evaluation metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) may be of limited value, but these methods were used to provide initial model validation.

## Results

The recommendation system successfully generated movie suggestions for each user based on both user and item similarities. The limited dataset size provides a good foundational validation, while the model structure allows for scaling up with larger, more diverse datasets.

## Future Improvements

To enhance the recommendation system, the following steps could be considered:
- **Increase Dataset Size**: Expand the dataset to include more users and movies for more robust recommendations.
- **Incorporate Implicit Feedback**: Use implicit feedback (such as viewing history or likes) to complement explicit ratings.
- **Hybrid Model**: Combine collaborative filtering with content-based recommendations to provide more nuanced suggestions.
- **Deploy Model**: Develop a REST API for live recommendations or integrate with a front-end interface.

## Installation

To run this recommendation system, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies.

## Usage

1. **Preprocess the data**: Ensure that the data is cleaned and structured in a user-item matrix format.
2. **Run User-Based Model**: Execute the user-based collaborative filtering model.
3. **Run Item-Based Model**: Execute the item-based collaborative filtering model.
4. **Get Recommendations**: Retrieve recommendations for a specific user or movie.
